# cargo-generate-templates

[cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) is a command line tool for creating projects
from a template. It's particularly focused on Rust projects but can also be used as a generic template engine.

This repo contains template projects for things I seem to start from scratch often.
